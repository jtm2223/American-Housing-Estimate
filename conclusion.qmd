# Conclusion
Through the project the American housing data was explord more in depth to get
a better grasp of where our nation has come from and is headed. This showed 
housing occupancy, vacancy rates and differences between physical and
financial condition throughout all different diverse states and regions all 
over. Main patterns that were found include housing conditions, the difference 
between renting and owning a home in the US and different conditions that go 
with the disparity of owning and renting in this country. However this research 
was limited to only historical data and nothing updated in real time so it is 
hard to truly get the main recent changes in housing trends. Another issue was
that some data lacked context and were not able to be utilized for deeper 
insights. Going forward or future research could include integrating more of a 
dynamically growing data set and more outside social economic data so that we 
are not just assuming from inference but actual data when creating these trends
and explain them. Overall lessons learned and takeaways are that we were able 
to gain meaningful analysis for combining cleaning techniques and different 
visualizations techniques to get a better grip of out country and the housing.
