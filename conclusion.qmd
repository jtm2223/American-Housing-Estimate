# Conclusion
Through the project the American housing data was explored more in depth to get
a better grasp of where our nation has come from and is headed. This showed 
housing occupancy, vacancy rates and differences between physical and
financial condition throughout all different diverse states and regions all 
over. Main patterns that were found include housing conditions, the difference 
between renting and owning a home in the US and conditions that go with that 
change of housing type. However this research was limited to only historical 
data and nothing updated in real time so it is hard to truly get the main 
recent changes in housing trends. Another issue was that some data lacked 
context and were not able to be utilized for deeper insights. Going forward for 
future research we could include integrating more of a dynamically growing data 
set and more outside social economic data. This is so we are not just assuming 
from inference but actual data when explaining trends that are found. Overall 
lessons learned and takeaways are that we were able to gain meaningful analysis 
from combining cleaning techniques and different visualizations techniques 
to get a better grip of our country and the housing.
