# Introduction
We chose this topic because adolescent health behaviors, such as physical 
activity, sleep patterns, and dietary habits, are critical determinants of 
long-term health outcomes. Understanding these behaviors provides valuable 
insights into the factors influencing the well-being of young people, who are 
at a formative stage of life. By analyzing the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance 
System (YRBSS) dataset, I aim to investigate questions such as: How do physical 
activity levels vary by age and grade? Are there significant disparities in 
sleep patterns across demographic groups? What is the relationship between 
screen time and physical activity levels? This analysis can help identify 
areas for targeted health interventions and inform policies to promote 
healthier lifestyles among adolescents, particularly for those who may be at 
higher risk of adverse health outcomes. For readers unfamiliar with the topic, 
the YRBSS is a national survey that monitors health-risk behaviors among youth, 
offering a comprehensive dataset for exploring these crucial questions.
