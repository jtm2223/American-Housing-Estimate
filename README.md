This project analyzes the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) 
dataset to explore health-related behaviors among adolescents. 
The study focuses on understanding the patterns in physical activity, 
sleep habits, and other key health indicators such as screen time 
and dietary choices. By performing exploratory data analysis, the project aims
to identify trends and correlations that highlight critical areas for public 
health interventions, particularly among youth in different grades and 
demographic groups. This work provides insights into how various risk factors 
might influence adolescent health outcomes.
