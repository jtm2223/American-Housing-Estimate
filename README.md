This project analyzes U.S. housing data from the American Community Survey (ACS)
to explore patterns and trends related to housing characteristics, such as 
occupancy status, household size, and gross rent. A key focus is on identifying 
missing data patterns to assess data quality and address potential gaps in the 
dataset. Insights gained from this analysis will help understand housing trends 
and ensure data completeness for accurate modeling and decision-making.
