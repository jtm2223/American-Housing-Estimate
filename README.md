This project examines housing data in the U.S. sourced from the American 
Community Survey (ACS) to uncover patterns and trends regarding housing
features, including occupancy status, household size, and gross rent. A primary 
objective is to identify patterns of missing data, which will help evaluate 
data quality and fill any potential gaps in the dataset. The insights derived 
from this analysis will enhance our understanding of housing trends and ensure 
our data is comprehensive, supporting accurate modeling and 
informed decision-making.
